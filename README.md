# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
For this project, I focused on creating a back end for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies such as Express.js, PostgreSQL and Sequelize so that a company can compete with other e-commerce companies. I built this back-end by modifying starter code.

### Key Learnings:
* **Sequelize:** Connect to a database using Sequelize using user credentials
* **Seeds and Schema:** 
* **Pg Admin:** Used PgAdmin to view data tables in the database and ensure data was updating properly.
* **Insomnia:** Utlized insomina to check GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes functionality.
