# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
This project involved creating a back end for an e-commerce website utilizing modern technologies such as Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize. The aim was to build a robust back-end system that can help a company stay competitive in the e-commerce market. The back end was developed by customizing starter code to fit specific requirements.

### Key Learnings:
* **Sequelize and PostgreSQL:**  Designed and implemented a relational database using Sequelize ORM and PostgreSQL, enabling efficient data management and interactions.
* **Insomnia:** Leveraged Insomnia to thoroughly test and verify the functionality of API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure reliable and expected behavior.
